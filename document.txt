This is a Node Js project made for the purpose of password validation.

To be acceptable, a password must satisfy these three rules:
- It must contain at least one vowel.
- It cannot contain three consecutive vowels or three consecutive consonants.
- It cannot contain two consecutive occurrences of the same letter, except for 'ee' or 'oo'.
- (For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'; all other letters are consonants.) Note that these rules are not perfect; there are many
common/pronounceable words that are not acceptable.

The project is made up using Node js with Express and the following packages have been used in the project

"body-parser": "^1.19.0",
"ejs": "^2.6.1",
